# CustomBlockLoader
PocketMine-MP plugin that adds new blocks to the server!

# Reference
This plugin is experimental. <br>
We are not responsible for any problems that arise on the server by using the experimental stage.

I am making it while referring to the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/blockreference/)
